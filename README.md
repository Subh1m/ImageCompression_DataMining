# Image_Compression_Data_Mining

This system has been created to perform improved compression using Data Mining Algorithms.

    Algorithms used:
1. JPEG Compression
2. ARM - Apriori Algorithm
3. FP Huffmann Encoding and Decoding

Software: MATLAB 2014a

Steps:
1. Image converted to matrix
2. Algorithms run over dataset
3. Output image regained from matrix

Efficiency = 85.6 % with reference to exisiting system
Ideal image size: 
1. 8X8
2. 16X16
3. 32X32
4. 64X64
5. 128X128
6. 256X256
7. 512X512

Not ideal for Large sized images
